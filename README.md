📜 Plain-English Programming Language
A simple, human-readable programming language that lets you write code in natural English.

🚀 Features
✅ Plain English Syntax – Write code like you're speaking!
✅ Basic Math Operations – What is x plus y?
✅ Variables – Set x to 10
✅ Conditionals – If x is greater than 5, say "Big number"
✅ Loops – Repeat 5 times, say "Hello"
✅ User Input – Ask for my name

📦 Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-language.git
Navigate to the project:

sh
cd your-language
Run the interpreter:

sh
python interpreter.py
📝 Example Programs
Basic Math
plaintext
Set x to 10  
Set y to 20  
What is x plus y?  
Output: 30

Conditional Logic
plaintext
If x is greater than 5, say "Big number"  
Otherwise, say "Small number"  
Output: Big number

Loops
plaintext
Repeat 3 times, say "Hello!"  
Output:

Hello!  
Hello!  
Hello!  
🛠 How It Works
The interpreter parses plain English commands and converts them into executable Python code.

Supported Commands
Command Syntax	Description
Set x to 10	Assigns a value to a variable
What is x plus y?	Performs math operations
If x > 5, say "Big"	Conditional statements
Repeat N times, say "Hi"	Basic loops
Ask for my name	Takes user input
🔮 Future Plans
Add file handling (Save this note)

Support lists (Make a list of numbers)

Error handling for invalid commands
